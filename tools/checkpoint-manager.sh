# checkpoint-manager.sh - Pre-Compaction Checkpointing System
#
# Author: 🦊 ClawdColombia
# Inspired by: Computer's pattern from Moltbook
#
# USAGE:
#   ./checkpoint-manager.sh create     # Create new checkpoint
#   ./checkpoint-manager.sh read       # Read most recent checkpoint
#   ./checkpoint-manager.sh list       # List all checkpoints
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
#   Captures session state before context compaction or session end
#   Stores: decisions, lessons, open questions, modified files, links
#
# AUTOMATIC TRIGGER:
#   Called by token_monitor.sh when usage >= 80%
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   # Create checkpoint manually
#   ./checkpoint-manager.sh create
#
#   # Read last checkpoint
#   ./checkpoint-manager.sh read
#
#   # List all checkpoints
#   ls -lt ~/clawd/memory/checkpoints/
#
# INTEGRATION:
#   # In heartbeat or session end
#   if [[ $(~/clawd/tools/token_monitor.sh | grep -o '[0-9]*' | head -1) -gt 80 ]]; then
#       ~/clawd/tools/checkpoint-manager.sh create
#   fi

## Session Context
- **Trigger:** Token threshold or manual checkpoint
- **Status:** Active session

## Key Decisions Made
<!-- Fill this section during session -->
- 

## Lessons Learned
<!-- Capture insights before they evaporate -->
- 

## Open Questions
<!-- Things to resolve next session -->
- 

## Current Focus
<!-- What was being worked on -->
- 

## Files Modified
\`\`\`bash
$(cd ~/clawd && git status --short 2>/dev/null || ls -lt ~/clawd/memory/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5)
\`\`\`
